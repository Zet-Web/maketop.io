                            <p>Anyone else wish they‚Äôd spent the beginning of quarantine trying to become TikTok famous
                                instead of, like, woefully staring at a sourdough starter and googling ‚Äúhow to not kill
                                indoor plants‚Äù?? Same, because now everyone is rich with money while the rest of us are
                                rich with yeast and potting soil.
                                Of course, there‚Äôs $ and then there‚Äôs $$$. Some TikTok stars have gotten so hugely
                                popular that they became millionaires in legit one year‚Äîthanks to both endorsements on
                                TikTok itself and leveraging their massive success on the app into, ya know, starring
                                roles in Netflix movies and friendships with Kardashians. On that note, here‚Äôs a look at
                                the highest-paid stars on TikTok.
                                Psst: Not alllll of 2021‚Äôs data is available yet, so these numbers are based on both
                                Forbes‚Äô list of the highest-earning TikTok stars in 2020 and everyone‚Äôs current net
